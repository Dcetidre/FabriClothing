Fabriclothing is a mod that adds wearables to minecraft, where you can craft and dye lots of outfits using patterns and tints. This mod is inspired by the old clothingcraft mod.

You need to craft fabric using a wool and some string, then you can craft patterns using the fabric item.

Lastly you can dye the outfit using the dye vat, using a fabric with a dye you can tint the color as you like.

There are two layers of colors for most outfits.

You can also tint directly in the crafting table however only the base layer will be colored.


There are some dyeable hats too, If you want to use them you need to install trinkets.
(for better hats I recomend : {curseforge hats mod})
